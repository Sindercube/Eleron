# About
**Eleron** is a **Fabric rewrite** of the **[Aileron](https://modrinth.com/mod/aileron)** mod, an overhaul to Minecraft's Elytra.

It adds new enchantments and behaviours while rebalancing some of it's existing behavior to be better suited for multiplayer gameplay

# Features

## Updraft Boosting
Campfire smoke boosts players upward when flying over it with an Elytra.

## Firework Contrails
Fireworks may no longer be used for speed boosts - they instead leave a lingering trail, purely for cosmetic purposes.

## Enchantments

- Smokestack
> Allows the player to store boosts while crouching on campfires, consuming them with the jump key while flying for a burst of speed. One maximum boost may be stored per level, capping at 3.
Incompatible with Cloudskipper.

- Cloudskipper
> Horizontal drag is reduced depending on the player's altitude, allowing them to glide for much longer and at much higher speeds while above the cloud layer.
Incompatible with Smokestack.
