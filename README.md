# 🔥 About

**Eleron** is a **Fabric 1.21+** rewrite of the **[Aileron](https://modrinth.com/mod/aileron)** mod, an overhaul to Minecraft's Elytra.

It adds new behaviours and enchantments while rebalancing some of its existing behavior to be better suited for multiplayer.

# ⚙️ Features

### Campfire Updrafts
Campfire smoke boosts players upward when flying over it.

### Firework Contrails
Fireworks now leave a lingering trail of smoke, purely for cosmetic purposes.

### Elytra Enchantments
Elytra can now be enchanted in the Enchanting Table.

The Unbreaking enchantment can be found by default.

#### Smokestack Enchantment
Allows the player to charge up boosts while crouching on Campfires.

Smokestack boosts can be used while flying for a burst of speed.

Adds one maximum boost per level. Maximum level is 3.

> The default key for boosting is `SPACE`.

> Incompatible with Cloudskipper.

#### Cloudskipper Enchantment
Horizontal drag is reduced while above the cloud layer.
