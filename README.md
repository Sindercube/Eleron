# About
**Eleron** is a **Fabric 1.21+** rewrite of the **[Aileron](https://modrinth.com/mod/aileron)** mod, an overhaul to Minecraft's Elytra.

It adds new behaviours and enchantments while rebalancing some of it's existing behavior to be better suited for multiplayer.

## Features

### Campfire Updrafts
Campfire smoke boosts players upward when flying over it.

### Firework Contrails
Fireworks now leave a lingering trail of smoke, purely for cosmetic purposes.
> The old firework behaviour can be enabled with the `fireworkBoostsFlight` gamerule.

### Elytra Enchantments
Elytra can now be enchanted in the Enchanting Table.

The Unbreaking enchantment can be found by default.

#### Smokestack
Allows the player to charge up boosts while crouching on Campfires.

Smokestack boosts can be used while flying for a burst of speed.

Adds one maximum boost per level. Maximum level is 3.

> The default key for boosting is `Space`.

> Incompatible with Cloudskipper.

#### Cloudskipper
Horizontal drag is reduced while above the cloud layer.

> Incompatible with Smokestack.

### Elytra Bouncing (Experimental)
Bounce off the ground while flying to build up momentum.
> Disabled by default, can be enabled with the `doElytraBounce` gamerule.
